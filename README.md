# 3D-Traveller
Find the number of ways of traversing a 3-D cartesian grid (3-D lattice) from one corner to the farthest opposite corner, at no point stepping in a direction away from the goal.

	        / .  /\
start->	 /____/..\  <- end

          \'__'\/ 


This is an extension of the problem where it is reqired to travel a 2D grid
from the top-left to bottom-right corner, moving only downwards or right.
